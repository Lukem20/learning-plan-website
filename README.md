# Individual Learning Plan Website

A portfolio-esque website that highlights the classes I'm taking at CSUMB and some of my work. This will eventually be used to build my actual portfolio. For now, I use this project to learn different features of Svelte & SvelteKit, along with integrating three.js into an app.

## Created with SvelteKit

This webiste is my first serious attempt using Svelte & SvelteKit to build a website. 

```bash
# Install node packages
npm install

# run on local host
npm run dev
```
